# business-review-webapp-MVC
This is an MVC web application created using Angular for the frontend and Firebase to store the data. Each city contains businesses, and each business contains reviews. When a new review is created, it is added to a current city/business if they exist, otherwise a new business and/or a new city will be created to hold the review.

### There are many improvements that are necessary for the application:
1) Remove parenthesis from business(es), review(s), and star(s) and make the words change from singular to plural dynamically based on the number.
2) When a new review is being created provide a selection list for the current cities and businesses.
3) Improve the UI design
4) Create a login so that users can delete reviews that they created
5) Make the app more mobile friendly
